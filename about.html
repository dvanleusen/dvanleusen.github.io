	<h1>Capture the moment</h1>
	<!-- Direct script/quote from Jasmine Lee Photography by Lorimerworks @ http://jasmineleephotography.com/ -->
	<p class="textBox">
		Photography has taught me to stop and smell the roses. 
		It is about noticing those details and living the moment a bit longer.
		Every photograph I take is an extension of my personality, 
		it allows me to show my perspective of the world. <br><br>
		
		Photography to me is very personal.
		I am truly inspired by a couple's love story.
		Every couple is unique, and good photography is about building trust and relationships.
		Making a connection with the couple is so important,
		because they can truly be themselves, and have a good time in front of the camera.
		I want my couples laughing together, having a great time, showing their affections for each other.
		And it is my job to capture those moments.<br><br>
		
		When I am shooting, I am looking for light, color, and composition. 
		But ultimately, I am looking for that moment from the couple.
		I love incorporating movements in my photography, whether it's them dancing, laughing, or even jumping.
		It's the couple's energy and love that truly makes a photograph real and genuine.
		And being able to share photographs with my clients is the ultimate reason why I am a photographer. <br><br>
		
		When I look at my photos, I see real people and real emotions.
		My photos are vibrant, creative, fresh, and timeless.
		When I am out in the field, I am bringing every ounce of love,
		passion, and energy to create the best imaginery I can for my couples.
		I love what I do because it allows me to express my creativity,
		meet amazing people and hear their stories, and I couldn't ask for more!<br><br>
		
		I'm Daniel van Leusen, and I am a wedding photographer.
